## Using Hat Bot
In order for Hat Bot to work properly you need to create a file called config.json at the root of the project, inside it must contain the following JSON:

```json
{
	"token": "your_token"
}
```

Upload a photograph including the word ```hat``` or ```hats``` in the comment. Each person detected will be blessed with a random article of stylish headgear.

Please note that at the moment, Hat Bot will sadly only detect human faces.
